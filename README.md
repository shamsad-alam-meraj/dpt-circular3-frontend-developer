### Best Practices Implemented:

- Modular Component Structure: Components are organized into smaller, reusable pieces for better maintainability and scalability.
- PropTypes Validation: PropTypes are used to validate component props, ensuring type safety and helping catch errors early.
- Conditional Rendering: Conditional rendering techniques are utilized to efficiently display different UI elements based on certain conditions.
- Destructuring: ES6 destructuring is used to extract values from objects and arrays, improving code readability.
